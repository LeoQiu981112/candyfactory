Candy-kids						 
This is a C program that handles the producer-consumer problem, producers(factories) and consumers(kids) are created using pthreads.
I used semaphores and mutex locks to ensure that data manipulation inside the shared buffer will not create any conflicts between threads, and protects the buffer itself.
